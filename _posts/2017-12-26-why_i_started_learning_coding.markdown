When I was a kid in elementary school, I had a friend who was older than me, and showed me a CLI games he actually made. It looked really cool, so I took a course to learn some kind of coding at summer school. It was long time ago, fun fact is that there was no internet  now I recall. I am not talking about 50 years ago, just to be clear. 
Anyway, it was a terrible course for the kids, I think, starting with some theory, and there was no actual coding in the class. It was not common learning coding or computers at that time, well, floppy disk was the main storage. 

Since then, I did not learn any about the codings, although I taught myself at least how to install/reinstall Windows. It took several days to learn with books, just reinstalling the Windows. Then, some dotcom bubbles came out, I learned a little bit of html, but it was just so weird for me to look at how it is written. I was interested in learning web codings, but did not move forward to learn more about the codings. 

Somehow, I have been working with business systems and developers for several years. And, I kinda had hard time understanding what makes hard for development, and if I can build any software myself. I am not going deeper into what makes hard, so hard to work with development and sometimes developers in communications as non-developer. What I wanted to learn and see is the second part. I tried and failed several times to learn coding before, I would like to see if I can build one myself, which might not be a great one, but that is working in my ideal processes. I am looking forward to completing this with the course.
